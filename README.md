# Sats ATM


![SatsATM Logo](https://emerald-real-clownfish-172.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreibnfqjqom5cb5j6hae2ubfx37y2rf6iou2b7iuziwxymkkwkihnrq)

A self-contained coin-to-Lightning machine built with an ESP32, HX-916 coin acceptor, and an Android tablet. Insert coins, enter your wallet LN address, receive sats instantly in your Lightning wallet. Powered by Blink.

No backend server. No VPS. Everything runs on the ESP32.

## How it works

```
Coins → HX-916 → PC817 → ESP32 → Blink API → visitor's Blink wallet
                              ↓
                       Android tablet (browser)
```

1. Visitor downloads the [Blink app](https://blink.sv/download), creates an account, and sets a username
2. Operator powers on the ESP32 — tablet opens `http://192.168.4.1`
3. On first boot, a settings screen appears — enter WiFi and Blink ATM wallet API credentials
4. ESP32 connects to the internet, fetches the EUR→sat rate and starting wallet balance
5. Machine is ready — visitor inserts coins, types their Blink username, receives sats

## Wiring

```
── 12V side (HX-916) ──────────────────────────────────
HX-916 RED    →  12V supply
HX-916 BLACK  →  GND (shared with ESP32 GND)
HX-916 WHITE  →  1kΩ resistor  →  PC817 pin 1 (anode)
                                   PC817 pin 2 (cathode)  →  GND

── 3.3V side (ESP32) ───────────────────────────────────
PC817 pin 4 (collector)  →  3.3V
PC817 pin 3 (emitter)    →  ESP32 GPIO4
                         →  10kΩ pulldown  →  GND
```

> ⚠️ The 12V and 3.3V sides share a common GND. Do not connect any other pins between sides.

---

## Network

The ESP32 runs in dual WiFi mode simultaneously:

| Mode | SSID | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Access Point (AP) | `SatsATM` | Tablet connects here |
| Station (STA) | Your hotspot / router | ESP32 reaches the internet |

The tablet connects to `SatsATM` and opens `http://192.168.4.1`. It never needs its own internet connection — all API calls go through the ESP32.

**Recommended internet source:** operator's phone hotspot. Credentials are entered via the settings screen and saved to ESP32 flash — no reflashing needed when moving between events.

---

## Arduino setup

### Required libraries

Install via Arduino Library Manager (**Tools → Manage Libraries**):

- **ArduinoJson** by Benoit Blanchon (v6+)

Everything else (`WiFi`, `WebServer`, `Preferences`, `WiFiClientSecure`) is included with the ESP32 Arduino core.

### Board settings

- Board: `ESP32 Dev Module`
- Partition scheme: `Default 4MB with spiffs` (or any with >1MB app)
- Upload speed: `921600`

### ESP32 Arduino core

If not already installed, add this URL to **Arduino → Preferences → Additional board manager URLs**:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
```
Then install `esp32` by Espressif Systems from **Tools → Board → Boards Manager**.

---

## Updating the tablet UI

The tablet UI is embedded directly in `ui.h` as a PROGMEM string — this avoids needing a filesystem on the ESP32.

If you edit `coin_atm_esp32.html`, you need to rebuild `ui.h`:

1. Open `ui.h`
2. Replace everything between `R"rawhtml(` and `)rawhtml"` with the updated HTML
3. Save and reflash

The wrapper structure in `ui.h` must stay exactly as-is:

```cpp
const char UI_HTML[] PROGMEM = R"rawhtml(
... full HTML content here ...
)rawhtml";

String getUI() { return String(FPSTR(UI_HTML)); }
```

---

## First boot / settings

On first power-on (or after a factory reset), the tablet will show the **Settings screen** automatically.

Enter:
- **WiFi SSID** — your phone hotspot or venue network name
- **WiFi password**
- **Blink Wallet ID** — look this up using the wallet ID lookup tool (see below)
- **Blink API Key** — generated at [blink.sv](https://blink.sv) → API Keys (Read + Write permissions)

Press **Save & Connect**. The ESP32 will test the WiFi connection, save credentials to flash, and reboot.

**To access settings again:** hold the ⚡ logo on the tablet screen for 3 seconds.

**Factory reset:** open settings → Factory Reset button (clears all saved credentials).

## Blink ATM wallet setup

1. Download the [Blink app](https://blink.sv/download)
2. Create an account and a BTC wallet
3. **Pre-fund the wallet** with enough sats before the event — the machine pays out from this balance
4. Generate an **API Key** at [blink.sv](https://blink.sv) with **Read + Write** permissions (not Receive)
5. Find your **Wallet ID** — it is a long hex string, *not* the same as the API key. Use this query against the Blink API to retrieve it:

```graphql
query {
  me {
    defaultAccount {
      wallets {
        id
        walletCurrency
        balance
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or open [`blink-lookup.html`](https://blankworker1.github.io/balanceATM/blink-lookup.html) in a browser — paste your API key and it returns the correct wallet ID with one click.

> ⚠️ The wallet is a **treasury** — sats flow out to visitors. The operator collects the physical coins as revenue. Monitor the wallet balance during events using the on-screen fuel gauge.

---

## Visitor flow

1. Download Blink app → create account → set a username (e.g. `alice`)
2. Insert coins into the ATM
3. When prompted, type your Blink username on the tablet (just `alice` — not `alice@blink.sv`)
4. Tap **Send my sats**
5. Sats arrive in your Blink wallet instantly

If the username is wrong, the payment fails and the visitor can retry — coins are not lost.

---

## Coin acceptor configuration

The HX-916 must be programmed to send the correct number of pulses per coin. Default in `config.h`:

```
PULSES_PER_EUR = 10
```

| Coin | Pulses |
|---|---|
| €0.50 | 5 |
| €1.00 | 10 |
| €2.00 | 20 |

Reprogram the HX-916 using its built-in programming mode (see HX-916 datasheet) if your pulse counts differ.

---

## Tablet setup

1. Connect tablet WiFi to `SatsATM` (password: `lightning`)
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `http://192.168.4.1`
3. Set screen timeout to **Never**: Settings → Display → Sleep → Never
4. Optional: use [Fully Kiosk Browser](https://www.fully-kiosk.com/) to lock the screen to this URL

## Security notes

This is a **proof-of-concept** for operator-supervised events. Known limitations:

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| TLS certificate verification | Disabled (`setInsecure()`) — PoC only |
| API key stored in ESP32 NVS flash | Accessible if device is physically compromised |
| No authentication on settings screen | Relies on physical AP access |
| Max credit per session | €10 (configurable in `config.h`) |

Do not deploy unattended or at high-value volumes without addressing these points.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Settings screen won't go away | WiFi connection failing | Check SSID/password, ensure hotspot is on |
| Rate shows `—` | Blink API unreachable | Check internet connection on ESP32 |
| Coins not detected | Wrong GPIO or wiring | Check PC817 wiring, confirm `COIN_PIN` in `config.h` |
| Payment failed — wrong username | Visitor mistyped | Retry with correct Blink username |
| Payment failed — API error | Wallet ID or API key wrong | Re-enter credentials in settings |
| Gauge always empty | Balance fetch failing | Check API key has Read permission |
| Wallet balance not updating after payment | Expected — balance deducted locally | Refreshes on next boot or idle poll |
